Meaning there is no loss of data on disk failure`\n4. `on replacing faulty disk the storage controller rebuilds the data on new disk`\n5. `if we are using 3 disk of 1TB for making raid` then\n\t1. `The raid has only 2TB capacity for data storage and 1TB is used for parity`\n\t2. `Always RAID storage is equal to size of the stripping meaning 2TB is used for striping and 1TB for parity`\n\n***How to calculate Parity***\n1. suppose we have `3 disk of 1TB` so `2 disk is used for striping and 1 disk is used to store pairity`\n2. suppose data is\n\t1. in `disk 1` data is `1011`\n\t2. in `disk 2` data is `0101`\n\t3. `Parity calculation = 1011 - 0101 = 0110` so `0010` is used to get our data if `1 disk` is failed\n\t4. so if `1 disk` is failed then we can get the data of failed disk just simply subtracting the `parity data - healty disk data`\n\t\t1. `x + y = z` so\n\t\t2. `y = z - x` like that\n\n***NOTE*** : Remember this `Parity disk` is different for different data meaning it is confirm out of `3 disk 2 disk is used for striping and 1 disk is used for parity but parity disk can be any disk for different data`. Example : \n1.  for data `1011 the parity disk can be disk No. 1 and striping disk can be disk No. 2 and disk No.3`\n2. for data `0001 the parity disk can be disk No. 3 and striping disk can be disk No. 1 and disk No. 2`  \n3. also if data is `Aditya` so it's binary is `10010010` so it stored as `1001 4 bit at disk No 1 and another 4-bit data which is 0010 at disk No. 2 this is called striping and their parity is at disk No. 3`","x":-840,"y":-260,"width":1040,"height":800,"color":"1"},
