Also every small change in `LVM` store in this location.\n\t1. `cd /etc/lvm/archive` then run\n\t2. `ls -ltrh` this command shows the the list of changes occur and restoring point in `LVM`\n\t\t1. `ls -ltrh | grep volume_group_name`\n\t\t2. above command show the restoring point example : `/volume_group_name_12344.vg`\n4. make sure to test before restoring the `LVM`\n5. `vgcfgrestore volume_group_name --test -f /etc/lvm/archive/volume_group_name_12344.vg`\n6. `vgcfgrestore volume_group_name -f /etc/lvm/archive/volume_group_name_12344.vg`. running same command again but this time without `--test`\n7. here our `LVM` is restored but it is in `in-activate` state so we need to `activate it`\n8. `lvs` this command shows the whether `LVM` is activated or not\n9. `lvscan` the `step 8 or step 9` does the same thing\n10. `lvchange -ay /dev/volume_group_name/lvm_name`\n11. `lvscan`\n12. `mount /dev/volume_group_name/lvm_name /test_dir`\n13. `cd /test_dir`\n14. `ll` you will see all the data that was deleted "}
