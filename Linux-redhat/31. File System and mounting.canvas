Even we can change `ext2` to `ext3` using this command\n\n1. `tune2fs -l /dev/sda | grep -i \"block count\"` this command display `block count`\n\t1. `block count` is reserved space and by default it is `5%`\n2. `tune2fs -m10 /dev/sda` here we change the block count from `5%` to `10%`\n\nalso,\n1. `ls /sbin/*fsck*` used to checked file system\n\n"},
