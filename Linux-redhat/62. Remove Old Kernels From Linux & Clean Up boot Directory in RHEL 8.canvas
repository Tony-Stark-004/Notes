For Red-Hat you need subscription for updating repository and packages.\nOne more thing our machine should have configured the repository that we want to update.\n\n1. `dnf update` will do `dnf` related patching\n2. `yum update` will do `yum` related patching\n3. `rpm update` will do `rpm` related patching\n\nHere,\n\n1. `du -sh /boot`\n\t1. Will show the `/boot` disk usage\n2. `rpm -q kernel`\n\t1. give you the all kernel present in your machine\n\t2. `-q` meaning query\n3. `uname -r`\n\t1. will give the kernel version which you used to boot-up your system. You should never removed the kernel that you used for booting\n4. `dnf remove kernel-version`\n\t1. `dnf remove kernel-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64` like that\n5. `rpm -e kernel-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64` this command also removed the kernel\n\t1. `-e` meaning erase\n6. now removing kernel does not remove the `vmlinuz` and `initramfs` file of that particular kernel so we need to remove it manually and make sure you remove same kernel version `vmlinuz` and `initramfs` file\n7. so `cd /boot`\n8. `ls`\n9. `rm -f vmlinuz-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64`\n10. `rm -f initramfs-kernel-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64.img`\n11. `ls` you will see the files are deleted\n12. `du -sh /boot` you will see the free space after deleting `kernel`\n\n"}
