This packages automatically create the `vmlinuz file` in `/boot directory`\n11. `cd /boot`\n12. `ls` you will see the `deleted vmlinuz image file`","x":-580,"y":-440,"width":760,"height":1100,"color":"1"},

Attach the same `ISO-image`\n2. Press `F2` to Open `BIOS` and go to `Boot tab`\n3. make `CD-ROM Drive` at the top  make it priority Drive\n4. and last press `f10` and save it\n5. Now machine will automatically reboot and give you the option \n6. select `Troubleshooting` option\n7. then choose `Rescue a CentOS stream system` or `Rescue a RedHat stream system` in case of `ContOS` and `RedHat`\n8. Now it will again give you `3-4 `options\n9. choose `continue` option but it will ask the `number of continue option`\n10. It will `mount` operating system present in ISO-image on `/sysroot directory` as `/mnt/sysroot`\n11. now it will ask to press enter to accessing the `sh shell`\n12. also we need package installation to create `vmlinuz image file` which is present at\n13. `cd /mnt/install/repo/BaseOS/Packages`\n14. `rpm -ivh --root=/mnt/sysimage --replacepkgs kernel-core-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64.rpm`\n\t1. `-goivh` meaning `install-vervose-printhash`\n\t2. `root=/mnt/sysimage` because we want to install it inside `root`\n15. to check whether it is created or not go to \n16. `cd /mnt/sysimage/boot/`\n\t1. here because OS is mounted on `/mnt/sysimage` and files are present in `/boot directory` so to see the `vmlinuz` we need to go to `/boot directory`\n17. `ls` you will see the `vmlinuz image file`\n18. run `touch /mnt/sysimage/.autorelabel` press enter\n\t1. This will do `SE-linux` relabeling\n\t2. `/.autorelabel` is hidden file because it start with  dot `.``\n19. again run `exit` to exit `sh-shell`\n20. now it do the process and then we need to `reboot the system`\n21. then make `Hard Drive` at the top meaning make it priority drive and press `f10` to save now\n22. you will see the grub menu and can choose kernel option","x":200,"y":-440,"width":860,"height":1100,"color":"5"},
