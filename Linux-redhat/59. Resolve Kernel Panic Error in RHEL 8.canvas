		{"id":"7f2a5c1a4ce3c954","type":"text","text":"# Regenerating `initramfs file`\n\n1. `uname -r`\n\t1. This will give you the kernel version. It is important to know the kernel version\n\t2. suppose it give `4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64`\n2. `dracut initramfs-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64.img 4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64`\n\t1. if `initramfs` file is corrupted then you need to run `dracut -f 4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64.img` \n\t2. we are creating new `initramfs file` so no need to use `-f`\n\t3. also we use `.img` after kernel version because kernel look for image file and then again kernel version\n3. `mkinitrd initramfs-4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64.img 4.18.0-305.3.1.e18.x86_64` command can also be used at the place of `dracut` do the same\n4. `mkinitrd initramfs-($uname -r) ($uname -r)` this will also do the job\n5. Now you can start your machine normally\n\n\n# How to start machine when `grub2 directory` or  `grub.cfg` file is deleted\nNOTE --> We have only one option we need to `boot` our machine with same iso-image which we used to install Linux.\nHere we are not re-installing Linux because re-installation may erase your data we just restoring the `grub2 directory`\n\n1. Attach the same `ISO-image`\n2. Open `BIOS` and go to `Boot tab`\n3. make `CD-ROM Drive` at the top  make it priority Drive\n4. and last press `f10` and save it\n5. Now machine will automatically reboot and give you the option \n6. select `Troubleshooting` option\n7. then choose `Rescue a CentOS stream system` or `Rescue a RedHat stream system` in case of `ContOS` and `RedHat`\n8. Now it will again give you `3-4 `options\n9. choose `continue` option but it will ask the `number of continue option`\n10. It will `mount` operating system present in ISO-image on `/sysroot directory` as `/mnt/sysroot`\n11. now it will ask to press enter to accessing the `sh shell`\n12. now run `lsblk` you \n\t1. You will see our `operating system` is mounted on `/mnt/sysroot`\n13. now we need to do `ch-rooting` so that we can change in our `operating system files` or can access in our `OS file`\n14. run `chroot /mnt/sysimage/` press enter\n\t1. you will see the `bash-shell`\n15. `grub2-install /dev/nvme0n1`\n\t1. here `/dev/nvme0n1` is the disk name on which `your ISO-image is mountend as /mnt/sysroot`\n16. `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`\n\t1. Here we are generating the `grub2 directory` or say `grub.cfg`\n\t2. also `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` is the path where we want to generate `grub2.cfg file`\n17. `touch /.autorelabel`\n\t1. This will do `SE-linux` relabeling\n\t2. `/.autorelabel` is hidden file because it start with  dot `.`\n18. now run `exit` to exit `bash-shell`\n19. again run `exit` to exit `sh-shell`\n20. now it do the process and then we need to `reboot the system`\n21. then make `Hard Drive` at the top meaning make it priority drive and press `f10` to save now\n22. you will see the grub menu and can choose kernel option\n\n# NOTE -->\nIf `grub.cfg` file is corrupted and not deleted then follow the same procedure just skip the `grub-install /dev/nvme0n1` step just need to do `grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg` ","x":160,"y":-240,"width":980,"height":1540,"color":"5"},
