You can consider Kubernetes container for Kubernetes\n\n# Services\n* It gives permanent static IP address to Pod\n* Also behaves as load balancer and decides which Pod is least busy for giving response\n\n# Ingress\n* It forward request to services meaning `https://my-app` this kind of URL is given by `Ingress` and `http://345.543.343.123:5000` is given by `Services` so `https://my-app` is mapped with `http://345.543.343.123:5000` and any request comes on `https://my-app` is forwarded to `http://345.543.343.123:5000`\n\n# ConfigMap\n* It is used to config variables so that we should rebuild the images and container present inside the Pod. ConfigMap is attached with Pod and any variable that needed by Pod is present in ConfigMap which can be easy to change and upgrade"},
		{"id":"01cdbe0f8f53f537","type":"text","text":"# Secrets\n* Same as ConfigMap but it is used to keep more secure variable like `Password and all`\n\n# Volumes\n* Because Kubernetes clusters Pods is non-persistence so to store the data we need volumes and it is recommend to configure the volumes outside the clusters and used as external device because Kubernetes do not include volumes provisioning\n\n# Deployment\n* It is blueprint file for making clusters and Pods called Deployment\n\n# StatefulSet\n* Because we replicate the Pods inside cluster in case one Pod are destroyed or having problem so our Application won't suffer.\n\n* But on replicating stateful Pods like database Pods which has state is not easy so we use `StatefulSet component` which synchronize the `read and write` between two database Pods because both pods are replication of one another so it is necessary to synchronize both the Pods otherwise Load balancer can get confused","x":120,"y":-240,"width":740,"height":700,"color":"5"},
